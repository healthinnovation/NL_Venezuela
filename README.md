# NL Venezuela - Tracking the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis and malaria re-emergence through remote sensing of nighttime lights

## Study description
In Venezuelan context the economic crises on healthcare provision, particularly on a localized scale, highlighting the underexplored use of nighttime lights to monitor service reduction in the absence of infrastructure damage. We focus on Venezuela's unprecedented socioeconomic and political crisis, triggering a major healthcare decline and an alarming rise in infectious diseases, such as malaria. The inadequate public health spending, a loss of medical assistance capacity, and crumbling basic services paint a grim picture. The deteriorating surveillance systems intensify concerns about malaria risk in the southeastern region. This study aims to use of nighttime lights to predict healthcare delivery reduction and the subsequent malaria surge in this challenging data-scarce context.
